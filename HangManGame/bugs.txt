1. Need to take into consideration if a letter user guesses appears more than once in the word. (for example,
'calgary' has more than one 'a', so need to make sure all instances of the letter appear.
2. Need to display the letters already guesses, so we don't duplicate.
3. If the user does not input a valid letter, loop an error message until they input a valid character.
4. The user should only be able to input ONE character at a time.
5. The output for the word progress needs to be on a separate line each letter guess.

Some various code snippets that don't quite function as expected:

    # sorted_letters_player_guesses = sorted(correct_letters_player_guesses)
    # word_guess_str = ''
    # sorted_letters_selected_word = sorted(list(selected_word))
    # num_of_guesses_allowed = len(selected_word) + 2

        # Does not compare properly
        # if sorted_letters_player_guesses == sorted_letters_selected_word:
        #
        #     print(f'{player_name} won! they found the word {selected_word}')
        #     return 'Victory!'

        # only works for first letter found
        # for _ in selected_word:
        #
        #     if _ == player_selection:
        #         index = selected_word.index(_)
        #         list_player_guess[index] = player_selection

        # appends every round of the while loop, not what we want
        # for i in list_player_guess:
        #     word_guess_str += i

        # doesn't work correctly
        # if word_guess_str == selected_word:
        #
        #     print(f'{player_name} has won!')
        #     return 'Victory'
