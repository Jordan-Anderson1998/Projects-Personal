Game Rules:

There are 25 briefcases which have an unknown random amount of $$$ inside the case.
The dollar amount in the cases ranges from $0.01 to $1,000,000. The player chooses an initial case, which they hope to be the case that contains the big winner.
The player selects 3 briefcases at a time, each case the player selects the $ amount in the case
is no longer available for the player to get. It gets crossed out.

At the end of each turn, the "dealer" will make an offer to the player, which they can 
take the money offer, or risk choosing 3 more cases in hope that they uncover the $1,000,000 cases at the very end.
If the player does not take any offer that the dealer makes, then the very last case they open will be the amount of money they win.

If the player takes the dealer's offer the game is over and they get that amount.
