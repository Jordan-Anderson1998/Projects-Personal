1. Test Function testIfCorrectDataType does not appear to have any effect, boolean operators true and false have the values 0 and 1 respectively, as such they can be passed as arguments to the functions.
Single character's such as 'a' have ASCII values, and so they can also be passed as arguments (unless they are invalid in their number system, for example 8, 9 are invalid Octal numbers.)
2. Function convertBinaryToDecimal - If parameter starts with 0, get unexpected results.
3. Using long int allows a much larger int argument to be passed into the function, however due to the nature of binary representation, the decimal calculation only equals around 524,000.
4. Functions to convert Octal and Quaternary to decimal, should have type long signed int in order to represent larger numbers in decimal.
