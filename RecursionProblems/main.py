Recursion Problems

1. Generate All Subsets (Power Set)
- Problem: Given a set of distinct integers, return all possible subsets.
- Concepts: Backtracking, recursion tree
- Bonus: Try it with duplicate elements and avoid duplicate subsets.

2. Permutations of a String
- Problem: Given a string, return all possible permutations.
- Concepts: Swapping, recursion depth
- Bonus: Handle duplicate characters efficiently.

3. N-Queens Problem
- Problem: Place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
- Concepts: Backtracking, constraint checking
- Bonus: Count all valid solutions, not just one.

4. Word Break Problem
- Problem: Given a string and a dictionary of words, determine if the string can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words.
- Concepts: Recursion with memoization
- Bonus: Return all possible segmentations.

5. Maze Solver
- Problem: Given a 2D grid with obstacles, find a path from the top-left to bottom-right.
- Concepts: Backtracking, recursion with direction vectors
- Bonus: Return all possible paths.

6. Recursive Palindrome Partitioning
- Problem: Partition a string into all possible combinations of palindromic substrings.
- Concepts: Backtracking, substring checking
- Bonus: Optimize with memoization.

7. Tower of Hanoi with Move Tracker
- Problem: Solve the Tower of Hanoi and return the sequence of moves.
- Concepts: Classic recursion, state tracking
- Bonus: Visualize the moves or animate them.

8. Count Ways to Climb Stairs (Variable Steps)
- Problem: You can climb 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time. How many ways to reach the top of a staircase with N steps?
- Concepts: Recursion with overlapping subproblems
- Bonus: Add constraints like forbidden steps.

9. Sum of All Paths in a Binary Tree
- Problem: Given a binary tree, return the sum of all root-to-leaf paths interpreted as numbers.
- Concepts: Tree traversal, recursive accumulation
- Bonus: Return the list of all path values.

10. Expression Add Operators
- Problem: Given a string of digits and a target value, insert +, -, or * operators to form expressions that evaluate to the target.
- Concepts: Recursion with expression building
- Bonus: Handle operator precedence correctly.

11. Fibonacci Sequence
    - Write a function to compute the n-term sequence of the fibonacci sequence.
